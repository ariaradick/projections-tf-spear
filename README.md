# Click [here](https://github.com/ariaradick/projections-tf-spear/issues/new?template=qc_update.yml) to make a QA report

Or, go to "Issues", press the "New issue" button in the top right, and then choose "QC Update". The form will ask a few questions. This helps us record the status of the QA, and initiate next steps.

For time range, you can leave blank to select all time ranges for the given variable and experiment. Otherwise, you can pass multiple by putting commas between them, e.g.,
```
20410101-20501231, 20110101-20201231, 20510101-20601231, 20310101-20401231
```
Please make sure all 30 ensemble members pass before reporting
